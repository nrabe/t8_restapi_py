This is a personal project, comparing Python vs Go for API development.

The goal is to have equivalent projects in both Python and Go.

GO version: https://github.com/nrabe/t8_restapi_go

Python version: https://github.com/nrabe/t8_restapi_py


Go tools used:

Goclipse IDE, auto-formatting with CMD+SHIFT+F, (some) code completion and syntax check, and AppEngine friendly (sort of).

Google Cloud SDK, to handle Appengine, Appengine GO SDK, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, etc. And the Google Eclipse plugin

	https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/download

Gorilla Web Tookit to handle JSON-RPC, sessions, authentication and context... ah, and it's Google AppEngine friendly

Google App Engine Datastore to store data.
